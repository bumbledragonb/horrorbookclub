          <h2 class="text-center" style="font-size:2rem;">The Hollow Places</h2>
          <h3 class="text-center mb-4">T. Kingfisher</h3>
          <p>Many of our bookclub members have read T. Kingfisher’s previous book <i>The Twisted Ones</i> and we all enjoyed it immensely. That book had put T. Kingfisher on our radar, so we are all extremely excited to read her new horror novel The Hollow Places together.</p>
          <p>Kara is recently divorced, currently unemployed and has a shaky relationship with her mother. She jumps at the opportunity to work and live at her uncle’s museum – The Glory to God Museum of Natural Wonders, Curiosities and Taxidermy. She has worked there previously during summers and enjoys the assortment of objects her uncle has collected. The museum has few visitors, and Kara’s job is mostly cataloguing objects and making sure the exhibitions are kept in good orders. One day she received a shipment of assorted antiquities and curiosities, most of it being unusable, except for a carving of an otter and a diary.</p>
          <p>She decides to exhibit the carving of the otter and starts reading the diary. Soon, she notices a whole in a wall that she can’t explain and when she investigates it, it goes on for much longer
            than the width of the wall. It seems to be a bunker, locked from the inside, and she can’t help opening the door…</p>
          <p>This book is inspired by the short story <i>The Willows</i> by book club favourite Algernon Blackwood. The main character can access a marshy parallel dimension where trees seem to be alive through a mysterious hole in the wall that can’t be closed and seems to grow every day. </p>
          <p>To prepare for this book discussion we will be reading <i>The Willows</i> and discussing it in the upcoming month before the meeting. We also encourage you to look and share curious exhibits in museums around the world. I, for example, have seen the haunted doll Robert in a guest exhibition at The Wellcome Collection in London. They say you need to ask for his permission to take his photo, but he hasn’t bothered me so far (That I know of, I am already a very unlucky person by nature).</p>

              <h3 class="mb-3">Next meeting on: 5th April 3pm GMT</h3>
              <p>Join us for a discussion about the book and stay as long as you like! We usually start with a round of quick impressions about the book and then go on to discuss the characters, plot and themes in more depth. Members are welcome to participate actively, or sit back and listen.</p>
              <p>The discussion is always full of spoilers, so if you haven't finished the book and want to discover it for yourself, please keep that in mind.</p>
              <p>If you can't make the time and date, we will be discussing the book on the <a href="">Discord</a> with and without spoilers throughout the month and members are always free to organise their own meetings. We even have international members who gather to discuss the book in other languages such as Spanish and German. So keep an eye out for those opportunities.</p>

              <p>WWe choose our books by majority vote. First we come up with a short list for the month, which might carry from the previous month or be completely new, depending on which books the members choose to keep. After we compile our top three choices, we vote again to decide between them.</p> 
              <p>We are aware that certain books might not be available easily, internationally, or affordably, so we always take into account all of our members. We avoid books that don't have accessible options or are too hard to source. Feel free to suggest an obscure out-of-print tomes (we love to find out about unknown authors), but please be aware that they will probably never be chosen as the book of the month. Members are, of course, always free to start their own discussions.</p>
